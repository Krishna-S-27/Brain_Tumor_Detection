# Brain Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning

This project uses classical ML models (SVM, RF, CNN) to classify brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor) from MRI images. The objective is to compare time efficiency with quantum models.

## How to Run

1. Clone repo
2. Place raw dataset in `data/raw/`
3. Run: `python run_pipeline.py`

## Structure

- `src/`: Code modules
- `models/`: Saved models
- `results/`: Evaluation outputs
- `notebooks/`: EDA notebook

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt`
